Peekaboo (peekaboo-store) is a simple and lightweight store management library.

I know.. Whatis so special? Another state management library? Why don't you use jotai or RTK?

Well, I said __store-management__, not __state__ management. 

## Why do you need peekaboo-store?

When you make a big application, it is hard to manage shared variable or constant. (even jotai atoms!)

Jotai or Redux Toolkit can be a solution that share some variable, but to find where it is, you will realize it is a tough work.

With peekaboo-store, we will have full-typescript support for the data structure.

```typescript

```
